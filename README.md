# Django-5.2-skeleton
Django E-commerce Skeleton — Built by Devs, for Devs
Not just another e-commerce template. This is a developer-first boilerplate built on pure Django — zero frontend distraction, 100% backend focus.
Whether you’re a Django enthusiast, a backend purist, or someone who just wants to learn how a real e-commerce engine ticks under the hood, this project is your playground.

What makes this different?

• No bloated UI, no CSS frameworks — just the core logic of a production-ready online store.

• Thoughtful folder structure and modular code you’d actually want to maintain.

• Commented, documented, and built to be forked, remixed, and scaled.

• Inspired by real-world apps — not tutorials.

Included out of the box:

• Auth system with registration, login, and user profiles

• Product catalog with categories, variants, and stock handling

• Shopping cart with session & user sync

• Order placement and management pipeline

• (Pluggable) payment gateway setup — ready for Stripe, PayPal, or your local provider

• Admin panel optimized for store managers
